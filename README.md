EAT OR QUIT

Eat or Quit is a Ruby CLI that can be used to search for restaurants and review them.

Restaurant information is supplied by Zomato's API (https://developers.zomato.com/api), which allows the user to browse through Zomato's extensive collection of restaurant profiles (US only for this CLI).

FEATURES

- Create or log in to a previously created username.

- Search for a restaurant by location and cuisine.

- Find out a city's densest restaurant areas to better inform your search.

- View a restaurant's profile.

- Create, view, edit, and delete your own reviews.
